## What it does

Layoff Evaders is a VR fitness game where players embody a software engineer fleeing from your evil boss. Dodge office obstacles and navigate through standup meetings, annual budget cuts, and performance reviews, all while performing real-life exercises like squats, lunges, and jumps. A connected dashboard tracks and displays stats like calories burned, jumps completed, and time spent active, empowering users to monitor their health.

## How we built it

We used Unity for game development and integrated motion tracking with VR controllers to detect physical exercises in real-time. For stat tracking, we created a backend using Firebase Realtime Database to store user data, while a sleek dashboard was developed with React for viewing progress and achievements. Each gameplay element was designed to align real-world movements with engaging VR mechanics.

## Challenges we ran into

- Mapping VR motion tracking accurately to in-game movements.
- Designing exercises that are fun yet accessible to players of all fitness levels.
- Creating humorous and relatable obstacles that resonate with tech workers.
- Balancing gameplay difficulty to keep it both challenging and entertaining.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Successfully gamifying fitness in a way that resonates with a specific audience.
- Creating a polished VR experience with accurate motion detection.
- Designing an interactive dashboard that motivates users to stay active.
- Infusing humor into a health-focused project, making it approachable and memorable.

## What we learned

- The importance of accessibility and inclusivity when designing fitness solutions.
- The technical intricacies of integrating VR motion tracking with meaningful gameplay mechanics.

## What's next for Layoff Evaders

- Implementing leetcode quick-time events
- Adding different stages and obstacles to further engage the player
- Monthly health reporting to encourage healthy habits
- Integrating wearables for deeper health insights, such as heart rate and step tracking.
- Partnering with tech companies to promote workplace wellness through the game.
